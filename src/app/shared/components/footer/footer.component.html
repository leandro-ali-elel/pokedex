<footer>
    <p>Hello, this is a footer. <br>
        I didn't know what to put here, so I used an API to request dad jokes randomly and try multi-api graphql
        configurations: <br>
    </p>
    <ng-container *ngIf="(joke$ | async ) as joke">
        <!-- :P -->
        <p><i>{{joke.joke.joke}}</i></p>
        <!-- :P -->
    </ng-container>
</footer>
